## 🚀 Our Mission

To revolutionize healthcare by building state-of-the-art, open-source **AI tools**, **datasets**, and **research** that help detect, diagnose, and deliver timely medical insights — especially in resource-limited settings.

## 🧠 What We Do

At OpenXHealth, we focus on applying **AI and deep learning** to medical imaging and healthcare diagnostics. Our projects span:

- 🧬 **Brain Tumor Classification** from MRI scans  
- 🫁 **COVID-19 & Pneumonia Detection** via chest X-rays  
- 🛣️ **Medical Anomaly Detection** with generative models & diffusion frameworks  
- 🏥 Building datasets, visualization tools, and explainability models (XAI)

We aim to **bridge the gap** between research and real-world clinical use.
